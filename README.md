## Contributing

Our team is looking for several contributions to be made.
1. Added added animations.  Specifically a drag-and-drop feature that allows users to drag cards to their hands and drag cards to the discard pile.
2. Added cards based on the cards of the actual game.
3. Chat is currently global so messages will be emitted to multiple rooms. Can make game chats private only to game room players.
4. Refractor using Redux.
5. Add video chat feature.
6. A feature that visually tells the player and all other players they are dead.
7. Implement the "Nope" card
8. Implement a "Trash" card that discards all the cards in the next player's hand.
9. A cooler exploding kitten/defuse animation/gameplay...right now it is automated.
10. A logout feature.
11. Ability to join a certain game.
12. Fix the bug with OAuth having to log in twice. Have fun!
13. Make code prettier.
